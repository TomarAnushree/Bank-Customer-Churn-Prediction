# Understanding Problem Statement

Decreasing the Customer Churn is a key goal for any business. Predicting Customer Churn (also known as Customer Attrition) represents an additional potential revenue source for any business. Customer Churn impacts the cost to the business. Higher Customer Churn leads to loss in revenue and the additional marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones. 
Our challenge is to analyze the past data and predict whether the customer will churn or not in the next 6 months. This would help the bank to have the right engagement with customers at the right time.

# Objective
